Not every security improvement needs a huge project plan.

Here are three lightweight wins teams can ship quickly:

1. Add a short cooldown after repeated login failures.
2. Turn on alerts for suspicious sign-in locations.
3. Review and rotate old API keys once a month.

These changes are boring in the best way: low effort, high value, and easy to maintain.

Security does not have to feel dramatic. Small habits usually beat heroic last-minute fixes.
