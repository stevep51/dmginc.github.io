This site is a blog about security engineering and threat detection.

Expect a mix of:

- Detection engineering patterns that hold up in production
- Cloud security architecture and operational hardening
- Threat detection writeups and response lessons
- Practical checklists and implementation notes

The goal is simple: practical insights you can apply quickly.
